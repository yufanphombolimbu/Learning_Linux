# Learning_Linux
  I am writing down a linux note as a learning. 
  Before writing this note, I have been using linux for a more than years ago. 
  But writing down a note on a linux helps to understand Linux archieture. 
  Why writing note is effectively while learning about new system or a archieture. 
  Writing down note helps to memorize and understand a system in a better way. 
  Taking note from a book from a the Linux Command Line.
